What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git folder gets created. We are required to create repository to track changes of our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It can contain only those files that belong to particular task. It shortens the size of commit.
